# How To Remove Yourself From Google

> ⚠️ LEGAL WARNING
> Every technique in this file is for EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.

If you find sensitive content indexed by Google, take steps to remove it: remove the content from the web, request removal via Search Console, and ask for cache removal.

Steps:
1. Remove or restrict the resource (move to private storage).
2. Use Google Search Console > Removals > Request removal of URL or cached copy.
3. If removal is urgent (PII), use the legal removals request.

What's next: Prevent re-indexing with `noindex` meta tags or `robots.txt` (see `prevent-file-indexing.md`).
