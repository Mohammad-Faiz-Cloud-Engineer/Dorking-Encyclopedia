## Key Terms

- **Dork / Google Dork / Google Hacking**: A carefully crafted search query using operators to reveal sensitive results in search engine indexes.
- **OSINT (Open Source Intelligence)**: Gathering intelligence from publicly available sources.
- **Operator**: A special search syntax that modifies queries, e.g., `site:`, `filetype:`.
- **Index / Indexing**: The process and data structure a search engine uses to store information about pages it crawls.
- **Cache**: A snapshot stored by a search engine showing how a page looked when crawled.
- **Banner Grabbing**: Retrieving the initial text a service returns (e.g., an HTTP or SSH banner) to learn its version.
- **Fingerprinting**: Techniques to determine what software or versions a target is running.
- **Recon / Reconnaissance**: The information-gathering phase of security testing.
- **Attack Surface**: The sum of points where an attacker can try to enter or extract data.
- **Bug Bounty**: A program where companies reward researchers for responsibly disclosing vulnerabilities.
- **CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)**: A standardized identifier for publicly known vulnerabilities.
- **Shodan / IoT search engine**: A search engine that indexes devices and services rather than web pages.
- **GHDB (Google Hacking Database)**: A curated list of Google dorks and examples.
- **Passive vs Active Reconnaissance**: Passive = using only public info; Active = interacting with or scanning the target.
- **Sensitive Data Exposure**: Publicly accessible secrets like API keys, passwords, or PII.
- **Directory Listing**: When a web server shows a file list for a folder (e.g., `index of`).
- **Robots.txt**: A site file that requests crawlers avoid certain paths — not an access control mechanism.
- **Favicon Hash**: A hash of a site's favicon used to fingerprint applications (popular in Shodan searches).
- **ASN (Autonomous System Number)**: A network identifier used to group IP ranges.
- **CIDR Notation**: A compact representation of IP ranges (e.g., `203.0.113.0/24`).
