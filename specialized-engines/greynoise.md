GreyNoise collects and analyzes internet background noise — scanners, bots, and mass probing. It's useful to filter noisy hosts from interesting ones.

**Use case:** Check if an IP is just an internet scanner or a targeted attacker.

**Quick example:** Use GreyNoise API to check `ip` and ignore low-signal hits when triaging.

**Risk Level:** 🟢 (tooling for triage)
