Bing offers `ip:` searches and sometimes different indexing behavior. Use `ip:` to discover pages hosted on the same address and combine with `site:` to narrow down.

Examples:
```
ip:93.184.216.34
ip:93.184.216.34 site:example.com
```

Tip: Bing's webmaster tools can show crawl errors and index status for domains you own.

Risk Level: 🟢 - 🟡
