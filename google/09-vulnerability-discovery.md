## 🧠 What Is This? (Start With the "Why")

Search engines can surface error messages, stack traces, and version strings that map to known CVEs. This file shows how to hunt for those indicators safely and what to do when you find them.

---

## 📖 The Basics

Search for error messages and versioned banners, then map findings to public CVE databases (NVD, MITRE) to assess risk.

---

### Error messages and stack traces

**Dorks:**
```
intext:"Stack trace" "Exception in thread" site:example.com
intext:"Fatal error" "on line" filetype:php
```

**Why:**
Stack traces may reveal file paths, function names, or versions.

**Risk Level:** 🟡

**Defend:**
Disable verbose errors and centralize logs.

---

### Version banners

**Dork:**
```
intext:"Apache/2.4.41 (Ubuntu)" site:example.com
```

**Why:**
Map version to CVEs and prioritize patching.

**Risk Level:** 🟡 - 🔴

---

### Finding apps with public changelogs or upgrade pages

**Dork:**
```
site:example.com "CHANGELOG" "v2."
```

**Why:**
Changelogs often mention vulnerable versions.

**Risk Level:** 🟡

---

## 🌍 Real-World Example

The Log4Shell (CVE-2021-44228) era showed that public web pages and docs revealing `log4j` versions helped defenders and attackers prioritize patches.

## ⚡ Quick Tips

- When you find a version, check NVD and vendor advisories.
- Prioritize exposures in publicly accessible systems.
