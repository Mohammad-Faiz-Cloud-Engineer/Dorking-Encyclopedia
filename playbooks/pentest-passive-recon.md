# Pentest — Passive Recon

> ⚠️ LEGAL WARNING
> Every technique in this file is for EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.

This playbook walks through passive reconnaissance for a penetration test: assets, subdomains, dorks, and OSINT aggregation.

Phases:
1. Asset discovery via search engines and CT logs
2. Technology fingerprinting with Shodan/Censys
3. Public repo and secret search on GitHub
4. Document and report findings

Include real dorks at each step and always avoid active scanning unless permitted.
